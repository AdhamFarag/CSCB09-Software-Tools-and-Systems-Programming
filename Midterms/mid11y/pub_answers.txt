Question 4

A. The function returns a pointer to a local structure variable. 
When the function terminates,
that local structure is destroyed,
so the pointer received by main is pointing to garbage memory.

B.
s[0] is set to be a pointer to the start of the 'a' string (the 'Z').
s[1] is set to be a pointer to the 'd'.
The 'd' then gets changed to an 'l'.
The output is therefore 'Zella 3'.
