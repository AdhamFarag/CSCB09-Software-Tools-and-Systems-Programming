Question 1

A. Read filenames, one per line, from file 'in'.
Output to file 'out' the number of lines in each of these files.

B. 
echo SEM >&2
or
echo SEM 1>&2

C. The shell uses fork to create a child process, 
and that child process uses exec to run the user's command. 
The parent cannot do the exec on its own because that would cause 
bash to get overwritten with the exec'd program.
